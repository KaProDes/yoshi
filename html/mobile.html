	I am a linux chad and an alpha vim user. I have the knowhow and the autism to literally lay down pipes in Linux; yeah, I'd pipe that.
	Recently switched to Windows 10 and I must say, after you get rid of the BS its a salvgeable OS, althought its terribly bloated. 
	Microsoft is that pervy pedo that likes to track you wher'er you go. <br>
	That being said, PowerShell is GG even though its not even in the same league as terminal (terminator was bae, RIP).
	Whatever OS you use, its a tool and one should enjoy the workflow rather than bitch about which Distro is better.<br>
	Take this from a guy who literally distro hopped every single month in AY 2018-2019. <br>
	9/11, will dual boot soon.<br>
	Lets shut up about it and get back to our misery.<br>

	<h3 class="w3-text-cyan">Chrome is literally Hitler</h3>
	<h5 class="w3-text-green">And why you should use Brave instead</h5>
	<h6 class="w3-text-purple">Kapil Deshmukh | 3rd June 2019 | 22:10:52 </h6>
    <p>So, the other day, in one of my vagabond pursuits, I tried out the desktop version of <a class="w3-text-green">Google Chrome</a>.<br>
I fired up my trusty Firefox and in true windows 10 dunce style downloaded an exe (Package management in Linux is so much better).<br>
After my endeavors at donkle-dink were over and my copy of Chrome was loaded up, I realized how unrefined and trashy it looked.
I mean in the sad-boi days of Internet Explorer, chrome was a good sent; quick, refined and snappy.
But, over the years, it has become a bloated mess with Google's telemetry being a cherry on top of the shit-cake that has become of Google Chrome.<br>
"Look how they massacred my boy," I would've exclaimed; but I realized that Chrome was hardly my jam and I cared two twinkle-tubs about it.<br>
Google chrome has become bad to the point that it has become a meme. It suffers from memory-hogging issues and eats away your system resources 
like there's no tomorrow. Not to mention how it fools you by feeling fast rather than being fast.
It is a fake it till you make it, situation like you've never seen before.<br>
As the gate keeper of the chromium project and the brand ambassador of the chromium world, Chrome gets a big L in my arrogant, entitled opinion.<br>

I had heard about the <a class="w3-text-green">Chromium Project</a> and how it was a God-sent in the noble mission to have universally compatible browser extensions.
So in true gobshite fashion I spent the afternoon testing out different Chromium based browsers - <a class="w3-text-green">Epic</a> is a dream come true for privacy aficionados,
<a class="w3-text-green">Vivaldi</a> just screams customization and stability - rightfully so since it is made by Jon von Tetzchner of the ex-Opera fame.
Furthermore, <a class="w3-text-green">Blisk</a> is a developer's best friend with its plethora of built in tools. Any web-dev should jump on the Blisk gravy-train ASAP, IMO.<br>
But, none of them impressed me as <a class="w3-text-green">Brave</a> did. Brave was faster, stable and chrome-esqe without the cheap feel that one associates chrome with nowadays.
For starters, Brave are the Godfathers of the Basic Attention Token aka <a class="w3-text-green">BAT</a> project which you can know more about <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/" target="_blank" class="w3-text-purple">here</a>.<br>
But, the TLDR; version of it is - BAT is project that rewards users to voluntarily view Ads in return for cash (upto $200 a year).<br>
Brave browser also has a novel approach when it comes to cookies, ads and trackers; something that we've just accepted as normal - a horrible status quo
that ought to change. Instead, it simply takes all those ads, cookies and trackers; shoves them into a dumpster and lights a fire over it - only to 
light a fat bong to make fat clouds in celebration of internet privacy.<br>
I bet they have a better, more sophisticated explanation of that; but its a BRAVE step in the right direction.<br>

In my testing, I found nearly everything 1.5 times faster than chrome; makes sense considering they has a stripped down approach as compared to our
Nazi Chrome overlords. <br>

Now if my privacy and speed arguments don't convert you or at least persuade you to try brave out - here is a handy list of white-knighting arguments<br>

<ul>
<li>Faster more secure, no tracking in the traditional sense</li>
<li>Chrome/Chromium extension support, so you don't miss out on your kitten homepage extension(looking at you, Mix, wink-wink)</li>
<li>TOR browsing built in - Nuff said</li>
<li>Underdog : 5.5 Million active users as against Chrome's massive 1 Billion - Don't be a normie </li>
<li>No questions asked ad blocking from the get-go | BAT program to volunteer to view Ads in exchange for some cash</li>
<li>Built on the philosophy that just because it is free, doesn't mean that the user is a marketable product for ad revenue</li>
<li>Brainchild of Brendan Eich (js creator, father of modern internet) and Brian Bondy (Co-founder of Mozilla)</li>
</ul> 

I know Evangelism does not work and so I am simply here to make this PSA.<br>
Give Brave a shot, its a Coderman64 certified product!
